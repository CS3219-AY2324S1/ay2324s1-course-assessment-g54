    "description": "The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.<br><br>* For example, `\"ACGAATTCCG\"` is a **DNA sequence**.<br><br>When studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.<br><br>Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.<br><br><br><br>**Example 1:** <br>**Input:**  s = \"AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT\"<br>**Output:**  [\"AAAAACCCCC\",\"CCCCCAAAAA\"]<br><br>**Example 2:** <br>**Input:**  s = \"AAAAAAAAAAAAA\"<br>**Output:**  [\"AAAAAAAAAA\"]<br><br><br>**Constraints:** <br>* `1 <= s.length <= 105`<br>* `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.<br><br>"
