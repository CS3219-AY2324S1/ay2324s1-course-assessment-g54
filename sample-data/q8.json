    "question_description": "The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.\nFor example, \"ACGAATTCCG\" is a DNA sequence.\nWhen studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.\nGiven a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter- long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT\" Output: [\"AAAAACCCCC\",\"CCCCCAAAAA\"]\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"AAAAAAAAAAAAA\" Output: [\"AAAAAAAAAA\"]\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= s.length <= 105\n- s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'."
