    "description": "The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.\n\n* For example, `\"ACGAATTCCG\"` is a **DNA sequence**.\n\nWhen studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.\n\nGiven a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n**Input:** s = \"AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT\"\n**Output:** [\"AAAAACCCCC\",\"CCCCCAAAAA\"]\n\n**Example 2:**\n**Input:** s = \"AAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n**Output:** [\"AAAAAAAAAA\"]\n\n**Constraints:**\n* `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n* `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.\n\n"
