    "description": "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:`I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.\n\n\n**Symbol**       **Value**\nI             1\nV             5\nX             10\nL             50\nC             100\nD             500\nM             1000\n\nFor example,`2` is written as `II`in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as`XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.\n\nRoman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n\n* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.\n* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.\n* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.\n\n**Example 1:**\n**Input:** s = \"III\"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** III = 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n**Input:** s = \"LVIII\"\n**Output:** 58\n**Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n**Input:** s = \"MCMXCIV\"\n**Output:** 1994\n**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.\n\n**Constraints:**\n* `1 <= s.length <= 15`\n* `s` contains onlythe characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.\n* It is **guaranteed**that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.\n\n"
