    "description": "There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.\n\n* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.\n\nReturn `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. \nTo take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.\n\n**Example 2:**\n**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. \nTo take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.\n\n**Constraints:**\n* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`\n* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`\n* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`\n* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`\n* All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.\n\n"
