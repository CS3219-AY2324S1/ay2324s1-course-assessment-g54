    "description": "There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.<br><br>* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.<br><br>Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.<br><br><br><br>**Example 1:** <br>**Input:**  numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]<br>**Output:**  true<br>**Explanation:**  There are a total of 2 courses to take. <br>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.<br><br>**Example 2:** <br>**Input:**  numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]<br>**Output:**  false<br>**Explanation:**  There are a total of 2 courses to take. <br>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.<br><br><br>**Constraints:** <br>* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`<br>* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`<br>* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`<br>* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`<br>* All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.<br><br>"
