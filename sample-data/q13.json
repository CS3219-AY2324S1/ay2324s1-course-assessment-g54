    "description": "`n` passengers board an airplane with exactly `n` seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:\n\n* Take their own seat if it is still available, and\n* Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied\n\nReturn *the probability that the* `nth` *person gets his own seat*.\n\n**Example 1:**\n**Input:** n = 1\n**Output:** 1.00000\n**Explanation:** The first person can only get the first seat.\n\n**Example 2:**\n**Input:** n = 2\n**Output:** 0.50000\n**Explanation:** The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat).\n\n**Constraints:**\n* `1 <= n <= 105`\n\n"
